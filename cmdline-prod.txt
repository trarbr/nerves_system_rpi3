# NOTES:
# 1. serial0 is magically replaced to the right thing by the RPi bootloader.
#    /dev/serial0 won't exist unless you make it, so don't expected it in
#    userland.
# 2. `fbcon=map:2` maps the framebuffer console to a non-existing framebuffer, thus silencing the RPi bootloader and Linux kernel
